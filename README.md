1- Machine Learning with Bank Data Using Pyspark

-Diabetes data set is one of the most known data available to ML enthusiasts and their learning purposes. The data is publically available  on databricks at: https://community.cloud.databricks.com

I focused only on three classifiers: i.) LogisticRegression, ii.) DecisionTreeClassifier, iii.) random forest. I share how to use StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder and VectorAssembler in pyspark. Secondly, I will be fitting the model using Pipeline.The accuracy I obtained for all three models is 1.
